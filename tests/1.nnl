# create mutable variable
var x = 1.23;

# reassign mutable variable to another type
x = "Hello"; # OK

# assign multiple variables in one line
var a = 30, b = false;

# initialize empty variable (it has special type `null`)
var c; # c is null

# create literal variable 
const y = "This is string";

# can check type of variable
var isYString = (y is string); # isYString = true

# can check for null
var isYNull = (y is null); # isYNull = false
